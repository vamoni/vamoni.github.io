    <h1>Xara</h1>
    <p>
      It was a rainy morning, less cloudy than I would of imagined. “Never mind
      the rain, Xara,” her Majesty said to me, “when you are under cover.” Easy
      for her to say. We were coming home from market where Queen Hilda scolded
      every pheasant she came across, and whether they did wrong or not, they
      got one whip per day. This was awful for the people who bought, for every
      day one less marketer was selling things to eat. I pleaded for forgivness
      for the people who ran away, but ungreatfull Hilda stuck up her nose and
      said, "Xara, you know I don't forgive people for anything, and I also
      don't take advice from a mirror maid like you!" I was a mirror maid, very
      true, but I still hated Queen Hilda. Even though she was right, I felt no
      passion for her. Her daughter, Allia, was very nice. She had gold curls of
      hair, and the Queen was always telling me to go brush them. Allia told me
      stories, and gave me fifty pennies instead of twenty. She was very kind. I
      loved her dearly, and no matter how many times the Queen slashed her, I
      brought her bandages against Hilda's orders, risking my own life for
      Allia's.
